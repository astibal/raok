## Raok
is very simple RADIUS  **testing** server which accepts any authentication or accounting and
prints it out. Unless you specify otherwise.
It supports challenges, and PAP/CHAP and various other small things good for testing.

NOTE: before start, run **raok-init.sh** to create default config files.

You can configure it in:  
```
/etc/raok/raok.cfg
```  
or from current directory, if the above is not found.  
```
./etc/raok.cfg
```

## Rasta

is very simple program sending RADIUS accounting  using the same config file.
